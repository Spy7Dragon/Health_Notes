		<p>The purpose of Health Notes is to have community of notes on health ideas.
		There are many health ideas and products in the world.
		Some of them may not be ideas worth trying.
		Sometimes when people are searching for health, the multiple things they’re doing may overlap in benefit.
 		This overlapping makes it difficult to pinpoint the ideas and products that are truly helpful.
 		As well, people with different experiences may have insights in to best practices for the health ideas and products.
		This website will allow users to look in to ideas and products that peek their interests.
 		The website allows the users to learn about other people’s experiences with a product or idea and then the user can choose if they want to try it as well.
 		There are many health philosophies, which can make the health industry a difficult location to navigate.
 		There are many good sources of health information.
 		One option is to completely trust a particular source.
 		The more difficult option is to perform scientific research.
 		The other option is this website.</p></b>
